    <h1>My City – Varanasi</h1>

    <article>
      <p>Varanasi, also known as Kashi or Banaras, is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Located on the banks of the sacred River Ganga in Uttar Pradesh, it is not just a city but a spiritual experience. The city is famous for its ancient temples, ghats, and its association with Hindu mythology and history.</p>

      <p>The ghats of Varanasi, especially Dashashwamedh Ghat and Manikarnika Ghat, are the heart of its cultural and spiritual life. Every evening, the Ganga Aarti performed with lamps, chants, and drums attracts thousands of devotees and tourists alike. The city is also known for its Banarasi silk sarees, street food, and classical music.</p>

      <p>Home to Banaras Hindu University (BHU), one of Asia's largest residential universities, Varanasi is not only about religion but also about education and learning. With a blend of tradition and modernity, the city continues to be a symbol of timeless India.</p>
